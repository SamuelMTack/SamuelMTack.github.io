                    <h2 class="major">Hobbies</h2>
                    <p>Outside of work Samuel enjoys a range of hands-on and social hobbies that blend strategy, creativity, and teamwork.</p>

                    <section>
                        <h3 class="major">League of Legends</h3>
                        <p>Samuel plays League of Legends regularly — focusing on strategic play, champion mastery, and team communication. He enjoys climbing solo queue when time allows but prefers organized flex games with friends. His approach emphasizes map awareness, objective control (dragon/baron), and effective shot-calling during mid-to-late game teamfights. He also experiments with champion builds and studies patch notes to adapt to meta shifts.</p>
                    </section>

                    <section>
                        <h3 class="major">Paintball</h3>
                        <p>Paintball offers a physical, adrenaline-filled counterpart to Samuel's gaming hobby. He enjoys both timed scenario matches and capture-the-flag style play. Key interests include field tactics, communication with teammates, and equipment upkeep (marker maintenance, protective gear). Paintball days are typically planned with a small group — striking a balance between competitiveness and social fun.</p>
                    </section>

                    <section>
                        <h3 class="major">3D Printing & Design</h3>
                        <p>Samuel designs and 3D prints practical projects and creative models. He works through the full pipeline: concept, CAD modeling (parametric modeling for repeatability), slicing, and printer tuning. Common projects include custom mounts, replacement parts, miniatures, and functional prototypes. He's comfortable troubleshooting print issues (bed adhesion, extrusion, layer shifts) and iterating on designs to improve fit and strength.</p>

                    <section>
                        <h3 class="major">Dungeons & Dragons</h3>
                        <p>Dungeons & Dragons is a regular hobby where Samuel alternates between player and Dungeon Master roles. He values the storytelling, collaborative problem solving, and roleplaying depth the game offers. As DM he prepares adventures, crafts NPCs, and creates maps; as a player he focuses on character development and meaningful in-game choices. Campaigns often span many sessions and are a core social activity among friends.</p>
